# Welcome to the Ellipsis Work Request skill

There are two main things you can do with this skill:

1. `create work request`: Create a new generic work request. You will be asked a series of questions to fill in and submit a request.

2. `create safety report`: Report a safety issue. You will be asked a different, safety-specific set of questions.

Both of these actions will create new **Fiix** work requests in the appropriate categories.
